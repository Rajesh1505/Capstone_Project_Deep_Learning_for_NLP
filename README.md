# Project Title:
**IndustryGPT: Specialized LLM Bot Using Pre-Trained Models**

## Overview

In this capstone project, We will embark on an exciting journey to create an Industry-Specific Large Language Model (LLM) Bot using state-of-the-art pre-trained models from sources like Hugging Face. The primary objective is to build an intelligent bot that can effectively engage with users by answering questions and providing insights specific to a chosen industry. This project will not only enhance our technical skills but also provide a deep understanding of the chosen industry's nuances, challenges, and trends.


## Project Background

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in transforming various industries by automating and enhancing communication. These models, especially those leveraging architectures like GPT-3 and beyond, are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, making them ideal for creating intelligent conversational agents.

This capstone project focuses on harnessing the power of pre-trained LLMs from platforms like Hugging Face to develop industry-specific bots. Students are given the freedom to choose from a diverse array of industries, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for applying LLM technology. The selected industry will guide the data collection process, ensuring that the bot is trained on relevant and specific information to enhance its contextual understanding and response accuracy.

By engaging in this project, we will not only learn to fine-tune pre-trained models but also gain hands-on experience in handling real-world data. The project is designed to be manageable even for those with limited computational resources. The primary objective is to build a bot that can think and engage with users effectively, providing coherent and contextually appropriate answers.

This project serves as a foundation for the Industry Immersion module, where students will extend their work into a comprehensive research paper, delving deeper into the chosen industry's specific applications and implications of LLM technology. This holistic approach ensures that students are well-prepared to tackle real-world challenges using cutting-edge AI technologies.
